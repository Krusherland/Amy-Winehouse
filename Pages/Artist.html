              Amy Winehouse (1983–2011) was a British singer-songwriter renowned
              for her deeply emotive voice and her genre-blending music that
              drew from jazz, soul, and R&B.
            </p>
            <p>
              Born on September 14, 1983, in Southgate, London, she grew up in a
              family with strong musical influences, particularly her father's
              love for jazz. Winehouse achieved international fame with her
              second album, Back to Black (2006), which won her five Grammy
              Awards, including Record of the Year for the hit single "Rehab."
              The album, characterized by its raw lyrics and retro production,
              became one of the best-selling records of the 21st century and
              established her as one of the defining artists of her generation.

              Known for her distinctive style, which included her iconic beehive
              hairstyle and winged eyeliner, Winehouse's life was marked by both
              creative brilliance and personal struggles. Her battles with
              addiction and the intense media scrutiny surrounding her private
              life overshadowed much of her career.
            </p>
            <p>
              Amy Winehouse tragically passed away on July 23, 2011, at the age
              of 27. Despite her untimely death, her impact on music endures,
              with her work continuing to inspire artists and fans worldwide.
              She remains an emblem of raw talent and vulnerability in the music
              industry.
